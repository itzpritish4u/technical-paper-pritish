## Good Practices for Software Development

  

### Review Questions

  

#### 1. Which points were new to you?

The recommendation to use screencasting tools like Loom and sandbox environments like Codepen to explain problems was particularly new to me. It makes a lot of sense in helping teammates understand issues faster and more clearly, especially for complex problems.

#### 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I believe I need to improve on communication, particularly in over-communicating and providing timely updates. To address this, I plan to be more proactive in using group channels and notifying my team about any blockers or progress updates more frequently. Additionally, I will work on structuring my questions more clearly, including relevant context and attempted solutions to make collaboration smoother.
