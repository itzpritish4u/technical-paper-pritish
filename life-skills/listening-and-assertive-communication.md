**2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?**

  

Reflective listening is a more empathetic approach to active listening, and the key points according to Fisher's model are:

  

1.  **Clarify the message**: Repeat the speaker’s message in your own words to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings.

2.  **Show empathy**: Use body language and tone to mirror the emotions of the speaker and show genuine understanding.

3.  **Verify understanding**: Ask questions if something is unclear and summarize the key points to make sure you understand correctly.

4.  **Confirm emotional content**: Reflect not only the speaker’s words but also their feelings, demonstrating that you understand their emotions.

5.  **Avoid over-simplification**: Ensure that your responses acknowledge the complexity of the speaker's feelings and message.

6.  **Encourage further discussion**: Invite the speaker to elaborate by creating a safe space for open dialogue.

  

Reflective listening is widely used in situations requiring precision, such as in critical scenarios between air traffic controllers and pilots, business meetings, and emotionally charged personal conversations.

Common obstacles in listening can include:

-  **Distractions**: Noise, other tasks, or internal thoughts that prevent full concentration.

-  **Prejudgment**: Jumping to conclusions or forming an opinion before the speaker finishes.

-  **Emotional triggers**: Reacting emotionally to certain topics which might cause you to stop listening objectively.

-  **Lack of interest**: If the topic doesn’t seem engaging, attention might wane.
