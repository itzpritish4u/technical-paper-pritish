# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Question 1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?**

The most interesting idea in BJ Fogg's video is his concept of making habits **tiny** to create lasting behavior change. Fogg highlights that the smaller the habit, the easier it is to start and maintain. For instance, he suggests starting with something as simple as flossing one tooth or doing two push-ups. This approach lowers the barrier to entry, making the habit feel less daunting and more achievable. Over time, as the tiny habit becomes part of the routine, it can naturally expand into a larger behavior without overwhelming the individual.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP is a formula created by BJ Fogg that explains how behavior (B) is driven by **Motivation (M)**, **Ability (A)**, and a **Prompt (P)**. For a behavior to occur, all three elements must align. Here's how this can be used to make new habits easier:

- **Motivation (M)**: Find a reason or desire to engage in the behavior. Higher motivation increases the likelihood of action, but motivation alone is not enough.
- **Ability (A)**: Make the habit as simple as possible, so it's easy to perform even when motivation is low. Lowering the complexity of the task increases the chances of success.
- **Prompt (P)**: Identify triggers that will remind you to perform the habit. Prompts can be external cues, like an alarm, or tied to an existing routine.

By adjusting these three factors, you can make it much easier to start and maintain new habits.

**Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebration is crucial because it creates a positive emotional connection to the habit. When you **celebrate** after completing a habit, your brain associates the action with a reward, reinforcing the behavior and making it more likely that you will repeat it. According to BJ Fogg, this emotional reinforcement helps turn a tiny habit into an ingrained part of your routine. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit because the brain craves that feeling of success, however small the action may be.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

**Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?**

The concept of **compound improvement**—getting 1% better every day—stood out as a powerful idea. The video explains how small, incremental improvements, when compounded over time, can lead to massive results. This notion of gradual progress counters the typical mindset of expecting immediate, large-scale success. The video illustrates this with examples from sports and personal development, showing that consistent, tiny changes accumulate into significant achievements over the long term.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

**Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

In "Atomic Habits," James Clear emphasizes that **identity** is at the core of habit formation. Instead of focusing solely on goals, Clear suggests adopting habits that align with the kind of person you want to become. For instance, instead of saying, “I want to run a marathon,” you could say, “I am a runner.” By aligning habits with your identity, it becomes easier to stick to them because they are congruent with how you see yourself. This shift from focusing on outcomes to focusing on identity helps sustain long-term behavior change.

**Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**

According to "Atomic Habits," making a habit easier can be achieved by following the principle of **reducing friction**. This involves simplifying the habit as much as possible. For example, if you want to go to the gym regularly, you could lay out your workout clothes the night before or choose a gym that is closer to your home or workplace. Additionally, using the "Two-Minute Rule" is another strategy, where you scale down your habit to something that takes just two minutes to complete. This makes the habit so simple that you can’t say no.

**Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**

To make a habit harder to do, "Atomic Habits" suggests **increasing friction** around the unwanted behavior. This can be done by adding steps or barriers that make the habit less convenient. For instance, if you want to reduce your time spent on social media, you could delete the app from your phone, requiring you to log in through a browser each time you want to check it. This extra step introduces friction, making it harder to engage in the habit, thereby reducing the frequency of the unwanted behavior.

## 5. Reflection

**Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, or the response satisfying?**

I want to read more books regularly. To make this habit easier, I will:

- **Make the cue obvious**: Place the book on my nightstand or where I usually sit, so it’s easily visible and acts as a reminder.
- **Make the habit more attractive**: Set a goal of reading just five pages a day to reduce the feeling of obligation and increase the likelihood that I’ll start.
- **Make the response satisfying**: Track my progress on a calendar and reward myself with something small (like a piece of chocolate or an episode of my favorite show) after completing a reading session.

**Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive, or the response unsatisfying?**

I want to spend less time mindlessly scrolling through social media. To reduce this habit, I will:

- **Make the cue invisible**: Remove social media apps from my phone and use website blockers on my browser during work hours.
- **Make the process unattractive**: Log out of social media platforms so that logging back in takes extra effort each time.
- **Make the response unsatisfying**: Replace the scrolling habit with an activity I enjoy more, such as reading or going for a walk, and celebrate after spending less time on my phone.
