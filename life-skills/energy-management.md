# Energy Management

### Question 1: What are the activities you do that make you relax – Calm quadrant?
When I need to relax, taking a walk in nature or listening to calming music works wonders. Sometimes, I’ll read something lighthearted to shift my mind away from daily stress. If I have more time, I enjoy cooking a simple meal or stretching to ease tension.

### Question 2: When do you find yourself getting into the Stress quadrant?
I usually feel stress building up when I’m working on tight deadlines or facing situations that feel uncertain. For example, when I’m learning something new but have to master it quickly, I feel that familiar stress coming on. I notice it mostly when my mind is racing, and I’m trying to organize tasks all at once.

### Question 3: How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?
I recognize the excitement quadrant when I feel energized and ready to take on a challenge. It’s that moment when I’m fully engaged and curious, often with a bit of adrenaline. For me, it usually happens when I’m close to achieving a goal or am in the flow of doing something I enjoy, like solving a tough problem.
