# Learning Process

### What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a method of learning where you explain a concept in simple terms to identify gaps in your understanding and reinforce your knowledge.

### In the TED talk by Barbara Oakley, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea is the concept of "chunking," where Barbara Oakley emphasizes breaking down complex topics into manageable pieces, allowing your brain to create stronger connections and improve learning.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Active mode of thinking is when you focus intensely on solving a problem, using concentration and deliberate effort, while diffused mode allows your brain to wander and make connections subconsciously, giving you a broader understanding of the topic.

### According to the video "Learn Anything in 20 Hours," what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?
1. Deconstruct the skill.
2. Learn just enough to self-correct.
3. Remove practice barriers.
4. Practice for at least 20 hours.

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- Use the Feynman Technique to teach concepts to myself or others.
- Alternate between active and diffused thinking modes for better comprehension.
- Break complex topics into smaller, digestible chunks and focus on deep work.
- Set clear, manageable deadlines for practice and assignments.
- Eliminate distractions, such as phone notifications, during study time to enhance focus.
- Practice new skills for at least 20 hours and track progress using productivity tools like Boosted.
