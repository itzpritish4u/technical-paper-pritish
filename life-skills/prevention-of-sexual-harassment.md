# Prevention of Sexual Harassment
## **What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?**
### 1. **Verbal Harassment**
   This involves using inappropriate or offensive language to make someone feel uncomfortable. Examples include:
   - **Sexual jokes** or comments about someone's body or appearance.
   - **Sexual innuendos** or suggestive remarks.
   - **Persistent flirting** or asking for dates after being rejected.
   - **Comments on sexual orientation or identity**, which can also be harassing if unwelcome.

### 2. **Physical Harassment**
   This refers to any unwanted physical contact or advances, such as:
   - **Touching** (e.g., shoulder, back, arm) without consent.
   - **Groping** or inappropriate physical contact, especially in private areas.
   - **Standing too close** or invading personal space intentionally to make someone uncomfortable.
   - **Sexual assault** (more severe physical harassment), which includes any coerced or non-consensual physical acts.

### 3. **Non-Verbal Harassment**
   This is behavior that does not involve spoken words but still makes someone uncomfortable:
   - **Sexually suggestive gestures**, such as winking, licking lips, or making lewd hand movements.
   - **Displaying sexual content**: Sharing or showing pornographic images, videos, or texts.
   - **Staring or leering** in a way that feels invasive or sexual.
   - **Inappropriate body language**, like continuous ogling or suggestive glances.

### 4. **Cyber Harassment**
   With the increasing use of digital communication, harassment can also occur online or through electronic devices:
   - **Unsolicited sexual messages or emails**, often referred to as "sexting."
   - **Inappropriate images** sent through messaging platforms or social media.
   - **Cyberstalking**: Following or monitoring someone online and sending unwanted messages.
   - **Sharing explicit content** without the personâ€™s consent (revenge porn or non-consensual pornography).

### 5. **Quid Pro Quo Harassment**
   This is a form of harassment where someone in a position of authority offers benefits or threatens harm based on acceptance or rejection of sexual advances. Examples include:
   - **Promises of promotion, raise, or job security** in exchange for sexual favors.
   - **Threats of demotion, firing, or poor performance reviews** if the sexual request is not fulfilled.
   - **Implied rewards** like better treatment or access to opportunities if the harassing behavior is accepted.

## **What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?**
- **Confront the behavior**: Clearly communicate that the behavior is unwanted and must stop. This is important because sometimes individuals may not realize the impact of their actions.
- **Document the incident**: Keep detailed records of what happened, including dates, times, places, and any witnesses. This can be crucial if the situation escalates and needs to be reported.
- **Report the behavior**: Every organization is required by law to have a sexual harassment policy. Report incidents to your HR department or the designated Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Act.
- **Seek support**: If the situation is distressing, confide in colleagues, friends, or a counselor. Emotional support can help you cope with the effects of harassment.
- **Follow up**: After filing a report, follow up with HR or the committee to ensure that your complaint is being handled properly. Escalate the issue if necessary if the response is inadequate or delayed.
